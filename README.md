# Cache-Project
 Spring boot app with cache mechanism

 Caching in a Spring Boot application is a technique used to store frequently accessed data in memory, so it can be retrieved quickly without hitting the database or other slow data sources. Spring Boot provides powerful caching capabilities out of the box, thanks to the @EnableCaching annotation, which allows you to enable caching in your Spring Boot applications easily.

 # Why Use Caching?

   1. Improved Performance: By reducing the number of database or API calls, caching helps to improve application performance and reduce response times.
   2. Reduced Latency: Cached data can be retrieved faster, providing quicker responses to the end-user.
   3. Lower Resource Usage: Caching can reduce the load on external resources, such as databases, APIs, and other external services, leading to lower costs and better efficiency.

 # Enabling Caching in Spring Boot

To enable caching, you need to:

  1. Add @EnableCaching to your main application class to enable Spring's caching support.
  2. Use annotations like @Cacheable, @CachePut, and @CacheEvict to manage caching at the method level.
